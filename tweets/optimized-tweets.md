# X Strategy - Tweet Optimization

This document tracks tweets optimized using Twitter Algorithm Optimizer skill.

## How It Works

When you give me a topic, I'll:
1. Analyze it against Twitter's algorithm (Real-graph, SimClusters, TwHIN, Tweepcred)
2. Optimize for engagement signals (likes, retweets, replies, bookmarks)
3. Generate multiple viral-ready drafts

## Today's Optimized Tweets

### Topic: Secret Scanning / API Keys

**Draft 1 (Controversy + Value):**
> "One leaked API key cost a company $500K. I built a VS Code extension that scans for secrets before you push. 
>
> Free forever because this should be standard. What's your excuse?"

**Draft 2 (Question + Community):**
> "How many times have you accidentally pushed an API key to GitHub? 
>
> I've done it. The panic is real. 
>
> Drop your worst secret-leak story in replies 👇"

**Draft 3 (Value + CTA):**
