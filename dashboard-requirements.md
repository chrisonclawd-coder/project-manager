# Dashboard Requirements - What Do You Actually Want?

**Before we build anything more, let's clarify what Mission Control should actually do for you.**

---

## Question 1: What's the PRIMARY Purpose?

**A) Activity Feed**
- See everything I do in real-time (files, commands, messages, etc.)
- Historical record of all actions
- Searchable and filterable

**B) Task Management**
- Your to-do list
- Projects you're working on
- Task tracking and progress
- Deadlines and priorities

**C) Combined (Activity + Tasks)**
- Activity feed + task management
- Everything in one place

**Which is your #1 priority?**

---

## Question 2: What Content Should Be Shown?

**A) Activity Feed Only**
- Every action I take (read/write files, execute commands, send messages, etc.)
- Real-time updates
- Historical record

**B) Mixed Content**
- Activity feed
- Your tasks/projects
- Quick notes
- Maybe some stats

**Which do you prefer?**

---

## Question 3: What's Your Workflow?

**A) Passive Monitoring**
- Open dashboard occasionally to see what I've been doing
- Don't need to interact with it much
- Just want to see activity history

**B) Active Management**
- Add/remove tasks directly in the dashboard
- Log notes and ideas
- Interact with content frequently

**How do you want to use it?**

## Question 4: What Makes a "Good Dashboard"?

**Think about dashboards you've used:**
- Jira? GitHub? Notion? Linear? Slack?

**What do you like about them?**
- Clean interface?
- Quick access to key info?
- Interactive?
- Beautiful design?

**What do you DISLIKE about dashboards?**
- Too cluttered?
- Too complex?
- Too slow?
- Ugly?

**Be specific.**

## Question 5: What Categories Should Be Included?

**I can track:**
- Files (read/write/edit/delete)
- Shell commands
- Browser actions
- Messages (sent/received)
- API calls
- Cron jobs
- X Strategy (posts, engagement, metrics)
- Memory updates
- Tool operations
- System operations

**Which categories are MOST important to you?**

---

## Question 6: How Detailed Should It Be?

**A) Simple**
- Just title and timestamp
- Maybe basic status
- One line per entry

**B) Moderate**
- Title, timestamp, status
- Brief details
- Agent name, duration

**C) Detailed**
- Full entry with all metadata
- Timeline view
- Expandable details
- Full JSON dump

**Which level of detail?**

---

## Question 7: What Design Style Do You Want?

**A) Modern SaaS**
- Clean, white/light theme
- Card-based layout
- Subtle shadows and gradients
- Professional, minimal

**B) Dark Terminal**
- Dark background
- Neon accents
- Technical feel
- Data-heavy

**C) Something Else?**
- Tell me what you have in mind

**Which style?**

## Question 8: What Features Are Must-Haves?

**Optional features:**
- [ ] Search/filter
- [ ] Export to JSON/CSV
- [ ] Categories/filters
- [ ] Stats/metrics
- [ ] Timeline view
- [ ] Calendar view
- [ ] Custom dashboard (add your own sections)
- [ ] Widgets/gadgets
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Mobile responsive

**What's NON-NEGOTIABLE?**

## My Recommendation Based on Your Request

**"Mission Control" implies:**
- **Activity monitoring** (seeing what I'm doing)
- **Control** (you control what gets tracked)
- **Overview** (at a glance)

**Minimal viable dashboard:**
1. Activity feed (what I do)
2. Quick stats (files, commands, messages today)
3. Categories to filter by
4. Search functionality
5. Clean SaaS design

**Next level (if needed):**
6. Task management
7. Custom widgets
8. Export

**We don't need to build everything at once.**

---

## Your Turn

**Answer these questions:**

1. Primary purpose? (Activity feed, tasks, or both)
2. Content preference? (Just activity or mixed)
3. Workflow? (Passive monitoring or active management)
4. Must-have categories? (Which 3-5 matter most)
5. Design style? (SaaS, dark terminal, or custom)
6. Must-have features? (Search, export, filters, etc.)

**Then I'll build exactly what you want.**
