**Step 2: Authenticate with Cloudflare** ⏳ IN PROGRESS
A terminal session is open. Please:

The terminal will ask for your token after you open the link.

**Step 3: Create tunnel** (after auth)
- I'll create a tunnel named "mission-control"

**Step 4: Configure routing**

**What you need to do:**

Once you paste the token, I'll continue with tunnel creation.
