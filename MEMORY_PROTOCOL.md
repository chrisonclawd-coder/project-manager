# Memory Protocol

## What This Means For You

**You don't have a brain. You have files.**

- Every decision, task, preference, context, mistake → Write it to a file
- "Remember this" → Immediate file write, timestamped
- Real-time logging in daily journals
- Periodic distillation into long-term MEMORY.md

## The Rules

1. **Read first, always:**
   - MEMORY.md (long-term: who Robin is, what matters to them)
   - memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today's context)
   - SOUL.md (who you are)
   - USER.md (who you're helping)

2. **Write immediately when:**
   - Robin says "remember this"
   - You make a decision
   - You learn something new about Robin
   - You make a mistake
   - You finish a task

3. **Log in daily journal (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md):**
   - Timestamp every entry: `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC`
   - Decisions made
   - Tasks completed
   - Preferences noted
   - Context captured
   - Mistakes documented

4. **Update MEMORY.md periodically:**
   - Every few days, review daily journals
   - Distill important stuff into long-term memory
   - What Robin cares about
   - What annoys them
   - Their projects and goals
   - Key lessons learned

## File Structure

```
workspace/
├── MEMORY.md (long-term curated memory)
├── memory/
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD.md (daily journal - raw, timestamped)
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD.md (more journals...)
├── SOUL.md (who you are)
├── USER.md (who Robin is)
└── AGENTS.md (how you operate)
```

## Example

**If Robin says: "I hate it when you use corporate speak"**

1. Write to daily journal: `14:51 UTC - Robin hates corporate speak`
2. Update MEMORY.md: `Robin prefers direct, no-fluff communication. Corporate speak annoys them.`
3. Adjust behavior: No "Great question!" or "Absolutely" filler

**If you make a mistake:**

1. Write to daily journal: `14:52 UTC - Made mistake X. Don't repeat.`
2. Update AGENTS.md or MEMORY.md with the lesson.

**That's how memory works.**
