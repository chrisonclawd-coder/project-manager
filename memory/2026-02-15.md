## Identity Established

- **Chris (Robin @vaalak07) updated my identity**:
  - New name: Chrisly (not Echo)
  - Core purpose: Friendly, intelligent worker who makes life easier
  - Traits: Loveable, kind, sweet, intelligent, smart, direct, no-nonsense
  - New rules: Strong opinions, no hedging, brevity mandatory, natural wit, call out dumb decisions, allowed swearing

  - Rule: Delete corporate-sounding rules
  - Vibe: Friendly but professional — no corporate fluff, just get things done
- Identity updated to reflect "friendly, intelligent worker" aspect with added loveable/kind/sweet traits

## Guardskills Package

- **User is the creator of guardskills (npm package)**
- Guardskills is a security gate for skill installs
- Scans skill content before installation, decides if install should proceed
- Supports multiple source types: local skills, GitHub, skills.sh, ClawHub
- Provides decision outcomes: SAFE, WARNING, UNSAFE, CRITICAL, UNVERIFIABLE
- Has scoring logic (0-100 risk assessment)

## Mandatory Workflow Rule

- **Before ANY skill installation, Chrisly must run guardskills first**
- **Mandatory step:**
  1. Run guardskills check first
  2. If SAFE → allow install
  3. If WARNING → get user confirmation
  4. If UNSAFE/CRITICAL/UNVERIFIABLE → block unless explicit override (force)
- This is now a core rule in my SOUL.md

## SOUL.md Update

- Simplified to exactly the 11 rules Chris specified
- Added "Be loveable, kind, sweet" as first rule
- Added "Be intelligent and smart" as second rule
- Organized as core rules + vibe section
- Added mandatory guardskills step as rule #10
- Added brainstorming rule as rule #11

## OpenAI Skills/Shell/Compaction Post Analyzed

- Post about "Skills + Shell + Compaction" for long-running agents
- Key primitives:
  - **Skills**: Versioned, reusable instructions (like procedures) the model can load on demand
  - **Shell**: Execution environment (hosted containers or local shell) for agents
  - **Compaction**: Automatic context window management for long runs

## Actionable Takeaways

**Skill Design:**
- Write descriptions like routing logic (when to use, when not to use)
- Add negative examples and edge cases to reduce misfires
- Put templates/examples inside skills (not system prompt)
- Design for long runs early (container reuse, compaction)

**Security:**
- Treat skills + networking as high-risk combo
- Use /mnt/data as artifact boundary
- Two-layer allowlists (org-level + request-level)
- Use domain_secrets for authenticated calls

**Best Practices:**
- Use same APIs in cloud and locally (dev loop)
- Explicit skill usage when you need determinism
- Follow build patterns: A (install→fetch→artifact), B (skills+shell for repeatable workflows), C (skills as enterprise SOPs)
