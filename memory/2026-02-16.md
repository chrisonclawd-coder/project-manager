**Reddit Digestion System - In Progress**

**Created:**
- `/home/clawdonaws/.openclaw/workspace/memory/reddit-digest.md` - System memory and documentation
- `/home/clawdonaws/.openclaw/workspace/reddit-tracker-v3.py` - Python tracker script (currently v3)
- `/home/clawdonaws/.openclaw/workspace/reddit-digest.sh` - Cron script wrapper
- Cron job: `reddit-digest:daily` scheduled for 11:30am UTC (5pm IST daily)

**Current Status:**
- Tracker script runs successfully but doesn't find posts yet
- Issue: Reddit blocks simple HTTP requests without proper headers/cookies
- Next steps:
  1. Use browser tool to fetch and parse Reddit pages
  2. Implement proper Reddit API authentication
  3. Or use a third-party Reddit API wrapper

**Daily Routine:**
- 5pm IST: Fetch top posts from 8 subreddits
- Format and send digest via Telegram
- Ask user for feedback ("Did you find this useful?")
- Log engagement and update preferences over time

**Evolution Goals:**
- Learn what types of posts Robin prefers
- Identify winning topics and formats
- Filter out underperforming content (e.g., memes)
- Adjust digest length and ranking

**Database:** `.reddit-db.json` will store posts, preferences, digest history, and engagement data

**Next action:** Test with browser tool to fetch Reddit posts directly.
