**Security Audit False Positives**
- Security scanner flagged brave-web-search and exa-web-search as "dangerous-exec" (child_process usage)
- Reality: Both skills use `execSync` to run curl commands for legitimate API calls (Brave Search API, Exa API)
- Security score: ✅ All clear (no actual security issues)
- Action: Keep skills, ignore false positives
- Recommendation: Optional improvement - replace curl with native fetch for cleaner code (doesn't change security posture)
- Other findings: Trusted proxies warning (gateway is local-only, so fine), attack surface looks good
