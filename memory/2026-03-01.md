### Backtest Progress - Triple RSI Implementation

**Goal:** Implement Triple RSI Mean-Reversion swing strategy (claimed 90% win rate)

#### What Was Done:

1. **Triple RSI Strategy Implemented:**
   - Entry: RSI < 30 (oversold), declined 3 days, was < 55 three days ago
   - Exit: 5% / 8% targets, 2% stop loss
   - File: `app/api/backtest/triple-rsi.ts`

2. **Yahoo Finance Integration:**
   - Added Yahoo Finance as data source for Indian stocks
   - Successfully tested with IDFCFIRSTB.NS, KOTAKBANK.NS
   - Returns 249 days of historical data

3. **Environment Issues:**
   - TWELVEDATA_API_KEY not configured in PM2
   - Using mock data fallback (not ideal)
   - Rate limiting issues with TwelveData

#### Current Results (US Stocks Only):

| Stock | Signals | Wins | Losses | Win Rate |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| AAPL | 16 | 4 | 12 | 25% |
| GOOGL | 15 | 2 | 13 | 13% |
| MSFT | 15 | 8 | 7 | 53% |
| TSLA | 15 | 6 | 9 | 40% |
| NVDA | 15 | 5 | 10 | 33% |

**Overall: 32.9% win rate** (25 wins, 51 losses)

#### Indian Stocks Status:
- KOTAKBANK, BAJAJ-AUTO, VEDL - Added to backtest
- Yahoo Finance integration working (confirmed 249 days data)
- But PM2 environment issues preventing proper fetching

#### Next Steps:
1. Fix PM2 environment variables
2. Test Yahoo Finance integration properly
3. Aim for 75% win rate target

#### Deployment:
- VPS: http://65.2.33.27:3000
- PM2: mission-control running
- GitHub: Code committed locally
