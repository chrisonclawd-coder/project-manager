[Thu 2026-02-19 18:51 UTC] I saw this on Twitter, so first go through it and understand and tell me how to do it One of the coolest things you can do with your @openclaw is to setup multiple bots and pair them with multiple telegram accounts So I have 3 "lead agents" paired to 3 telegram accounts - me, my wife and my son Each of the lead agents has 2 or 3 sub agents to hand off work to as needed.. Each with their own soul, session, workspace etc. You need make changes to the opnclaw json file - Add to "agents" list - add to "bindings" - add to "channels" Create telegram bots via botfather corresponding to each agent. And then pair them manually following the onboarding steps
assistant: ## Multi-Agent Setup - 3 People, 3 Bots

**Goal:** 3 isolated agents (you, wife, son) each with their own Telegram bot and 2-3 subagents.

---

### Step 1: Create 3 Agent Workspaces

```bash
# Create workspace for you
openclaw agents add robin

# Create workspace for your wife  
openclaw agents add wife

# Create workspace for your son
openclaw agents add son
```

Each will get its own:
- `~/.openclaw/workspace-<id>/` (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md, etc.)
- `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/` (auth profiles, sessions)
- Separate personality/rules

---

### Step 2: Create 3 Telegram Bots via BotFather

1. Open Telegram → search `@BotFather`
2. `/newbot` for each person:
   - Robin's bot: `@robin_assistant_bot`
   - Wife's bot: `@wife_assistant_bot`
   - Son's bot: `@son_assistant_bot`
3. Copy each token

Example BotFather flow:
```
BotFather: Name your bot: Robin's Assistant
BotFather: Username for your bot (required): robin_assistant_bot
BotFather: Now, write a short description for your bot: Personal assistant for Robin
BotFather: Token: 123456:ABC... (copy this)
```

---

### Step 3: Update openclaw.json

Add 3 agents, 3 Telegram accounts, and bindings.

**Key sections to add:**

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      {
        id: "robin",
        name: "Robin",
        workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace-robin",
        agentDir: "~/.openclaw/agents/robin/agent",
        identity: { name: "Robin's Assistant" }
      },
      {
        id: "wife",
        name: "Wife",
        workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace-wife",
        agentDir: "~/.openclaw/agents/wife/agent",
        identity: { name: "Wife's Assistant" }
      },
      {
        id: "son",
        name: "Son",
        workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace-son",
        agentDir: "~/.openclaw/agents/son/agent",
        identity: { name: "Son's Assistant" }
      }
    ]
  },

  channels: {
    telegram: {
      accounts: {
        robin: {
          botToken: "YOUR_ROBIN_BOT_TOKEN",
          dmPolicy: "allowlist",
          allowFrom: ["tg:7065433847"]  // Your telegram ID
        },
        wife: {
          botToken: "YOUR_WIFE_BOT_TOKEN",
          dmPolicy: "allowlist",
          allowFrom: ["tg:WIFE_TELEGRAM_ID"]
        },
        son: {
          botToken: "YOUR_SON_BOT_TOKEN",
          dmPolicy: "allowlist", 
          allowFrom: ["tg:SON_TELEGRAM_ID"]
        }
      }
    }
  },

  bindings: [
    {
      agentId: "robin",
      match: { channel: "telegram", accountId: "robin" }
    },
    {
      agentId: "wife",
      match: { channel: "telegram", accountId: "wife" }
    },
    {
      agentId: "son",
      match: { channel: "telegram", accountId: "son" }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Step 4: Restart Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

---

### Step 5: Verify Setup

```bash
openclaw agents list --bindings
openclaw channels status --probe
```

Should show 3 agents with their Telegram accounts and bindings.

---

### Step 6: Pair Bots to Your Telegram Accounts

**For each bot:**

1. Message the bot on Telegram: `/start` (if needed)
2. Bot will send a link like:
   ```
   https://openclaw.app/attach/bot?token=...
   ```
3. Click the link and follow onboarding to pair it

---

### Step 7: Create Subagents (Optional)

Each lead agent can have subagents for specific tasks:

**Robin's agents:**
- x-strategy-subagent (for X engagement)
- blogwatcher-subagent (for blog reading)

**Wife's agents:**
- shopping-helper
- schedule-manager

**Son's agents:**
- homework-helper
- gaming-researcher

Create subagents the same way (different workspaces, personalities).

---

### Key Points

- **Each agent is fully isolated:** separate workspaces, sessions, auth
- **Each has its own bot:** 3 separate Telegram accounts
- **Bindings route messages:** deterministic routing based on accountId
- **Subagents hand off work:** spawn from lead agent into isolated sessions
- **Personalities:** Each agent's SOUL.md defines its behavior

assistant: **Done.** 

**3-agent setup guide sent to your chat.**

Key steps:
1. `openclaw agents add robin` (repeat for wife, son)
2. Create 3 Telegram bots via BotFather
3. Add agents + Telegram accounts + bindings to `openclaw.json`
4. Restart gateway
5. Pair each bot to the person's Telegram account

Each agent is fully isolated with its own bot, workspace, personality, and subagents. Ready to proceed?
