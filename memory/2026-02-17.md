**Blogwatcher Direct Chat Delivery Set Up**

**Problem:** Needed blogwatcher reports delivered directly to Telegram chat, not just saved to a file.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Created `/home/clawdonaws/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/blogwatcher-telegram.sh`
   - Runs blogwatcher scan
   - Posts results directly to Telegram via API
   - Uses TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID environment variables

2. Updated cron job configuration:
   - sessionTarget: "isolated"
   - payload.kind: "agentTurn"
   - delivery.mode: "announce"
   - delivery.channel: "telegram"
   - delivery.to: "7065433847"

3. Cron job runs daily at 9am IST

**Status:**
- Script created and made executable
- Cron job updated with direct delivery
- Manual test triggered successfully

**Result:** Blogwatcher will now post scan results directly to your Telegram chat every morning at 9am IST.

**Environment Variables Required:**
- TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
- TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID

Make sure these are set in your environment or the script will fail.
