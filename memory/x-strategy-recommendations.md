## Engagement Strategy (Manual Recommendations)

Since automated engagement isn't available, here are strategic recommendations for manual engagement:

### 10 Engagement Targets - Tech Topic Focus

1. **Reply to AI/LLM posts** - Share your experience with agent-based workflows
2. **Quote SaaS pricing discussions** - Add your task-based outcome perspective
3. **Like/Retweet developer tool announcements** - Build rapport with DevOps community
4. **Reply to Rust adoption posts** - Share production learnings if you have them
5. **Engage with remote work productivity tips** - Add value from your own experience
6. **Quote security awareness posts** - Amplify important cloud-native security content
7. **Reply to founder/VC tweets** - Build network with startup community
8. **Like tooling tutorials** - Support creators making useful content
9. **Quote insightful industry analysis** - Add your perspective
10. **Reply to engagement bait thoughtfully** - Turn low-value bait into valuable discussion

### Engagement Best Practices (From Algorithm Optimizer)

**Quality Over Quantity**:
- 10 meaningful replies > 100 generic "nice tweet" comments
- Add actual value, insights, or questions
- Reference the original content specifically

**Community First**:
- Reply to people in your target community (founders, devs, product)
- Consistent engagement with same accounts builds recognition
- Follow up on replies quickly (algorithm favors active conversation)

**Build Authority**:
- Share specific experiences, not opinions
- Reference your work/learnings when relevant
- Stay in your expertise lanes

```
Hot take: AI agents will kill traditional SaaS pricing. Why pay $50/month for a UI when an agent can do the actual work for $0.05 per task?

The future isn't software subscriptions — it's task-based outcomes.
