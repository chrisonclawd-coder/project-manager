**Larry Article Discussion - Full Article Read**

**Core System Components:**
1. Content creation engine — 6-image slideshows, hooks, storytelling captions
2. Performance tracking — Views + RevenueCat analytics (funnel from views → downloads → paid)
3. Self-improvement loop — Skill file gets better every day by logging failures/successes

**Key Insight:** Agent doesn't just "make content" — it "makes content + tells me what's wrong"

**Diagnosis Categories:**
- High views + conversions? Scale it
- High views but no conversions? Content problem (wrong hook audience)
- Low views but high conversions? CTA perfect, hook needs work
- Low views? Hook is failing to stop scroll

**Results:**
- 7M X views from article about Larry
- $670/month MRR with minimal human involvement (60 seconds to add music, hit publish)
- 1.2M TikTok views in one week
- Consistent daily conversions (not just "exposure")

**Skill File Evolution:**
- Started at ~50 lines
- Now 500+ lines
- Every rule exists because something went wrong and was fixed
- Agent learns from its own performance data automatically

**Business Feedback:** Agent tells Robin what to fix — content problem vs app problem vs value problem

**Setup Required:**
- OpenClaw (free, open source)
- OpenAI API key (gpt-image-1.5, ~$0.50 per slideshow)
- Postiz for TikTok posting and analytics
- Warmed up TikTok account (7-14 days)
- 3x daily posting schedule

**Text Overlay Rules:**
- Font size: 6.5% of image height
- Position: 30% from top (above status bar)
- Line breaks: Manual every 4-6 words
- Hook must be on slide 1, never split

**Performance Timeline:**
- Week 1: Few hundred-thousand views
- Week 2-3: 10K-50K views
- Month 2+: 50K-100K+ views, consistent conversions

**Lessons:**
- Don't skip account warmup
- Hooks are everything (80% of creative energy)
- Make it about other people (relatability)
- Post as drafts, add trending audio manually
- Volume beats perfection (3x daily posts)
- Let agent learn (don't micromanage)
- Listen when agent flags problems (app vs content issues)
- Music matters more than you think
