## [LRN-20260220-001] self_improvement_setup

**Logged**: 2026-02-20T19:10:00Z
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: pending

### Summary
Self-improvement skill needs to be installed from correct GitHub repo: peterskoett/self-improving-agent, not sundial-org/awesome-openclaw-skills

### Details
Initial attempt to install from sundial-org/awesome-openclaw-skills failed because skill doesn't exist there. The correct source is https://github.com/peterskoett/self-improving-agent

Created custom self-improvement skill with:
- SKILL.md with logging instructions
- .learnings/ directory with ERRORS.md, LEARNINGS.md, FEATURE_REQUESTS.md
- Log format: [TYPE-YYYYMMDD-XXX] with priority and status fields

### Suggested Action
Next time, verify skill exists in repository before installing. Use correct GitHub URL: https://github.com/peterskoett/self-improving-agent
