**Session Type:** Technical/Funny Engagement Question
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Step 1: Generate Engagement Question

**Goal:** Create a technical question that's:
- ✅ Engaging (gets replies)
- ✅ Funny/Interesting (not boring)
- ✅ Open-ended (invites discussion)
- ✅ Technical (shows expertise)

## Question Ideas

**Template 1: "Dev vs. Production"**
- "In dev mode, I save all the time. In production, production saves all the time."
- "Dev is where I debug. Production is where debug wears debug glasses."

**Template 2: "Technology Philosophy"**
- "I don't have an attitude problem. I just have a different perspective."
- "CSS makes the front-end. Production makes the browser crash."

**Template 3: "Technical Reality"**
- "My code works in development. In production, it works... sometimes."
- "99 bugs in the code, 99 in production, fix one to deploy..."

**Template 4: "Funny/Relatable"**
- "I asked my code to commit, and it said 'make it an array'." 🤣
- "My code has more lines than a phone book. Production loves that."
