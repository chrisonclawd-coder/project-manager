# X Strategy - Day 1: Decode the Best Post

**Goal:** Find the formula that generated 198 views (1 like) - replicate it.

---

## Step 1: Identify the Best Post

**Post 1 stats:**
- Views: 198
- Likes: 1
- Reposts: 0
- Replies: 0
- Time: 3 hours ago

**Question to answer:**
1. What was the hook (first 5 words)?
2. What format was used (image, thread, link, opinion)?
3. Who did it mention/tag?
4. What made it scannable?

---

## Step 2: Analyze the Post

**Fill this in:**

### Hook:
```
[Insert the first 5 words of Post 1]
```

### Format:
- [ ] Image
- [ ] Text thread
- [ ] Link
- [ ] Opinion/tweet
- [ ] Other: _____

### Mentions/Tags:
```
@mentions here
```

### Length:
- [ ] 50-80 characters
- [ ] 81-120 characters
- [ ] 121+ characters

### Hashtags:
- [ ] 0
- [ ] 1-2
- [ ] 3+

## Step 3: The Formula

**Based on your best post, here's the formula to replicate:**

### Formula:
1. **Hook:** [your hook here]
2. **Body:** [3-4 sentences explaining]
3. **CTA:** [call to action]
4. **Format:** [image/text/thread/link]

### Template to use tomorrow:
```
Hook: [Provocative claim or question]

Body: [3-4 sentences explaining why]

CTA: [Call to action - tag someone, ask question, etc.]

Format: [Image/text/thread/link]
```

---

## Step 4: Post 1 Checklist

Tomorrow, before posting, check:

- [ ] Hook is under 80 characters
- [ ] Body is 3-4 sentences
- [ ] CTA is clear and actionable
- [ ] Mention 1 tech creator
- [ ] Post at 2pm-6pm IST
- [ ] Include media (image increases engagement 2-3x)
- [ ] Use 2-3 emojis max
- [ ] Use 1-2 hashtags max

---

## Step 5: What If It Doesn't Work?

**If Day 2 post gets <150 views:**
1. Change the hook
2. Try different format (image → text, or vice versa)
3. Test different posting time
4. Mention different tech creators

**If Day 2 post gets 150-250 views:**
1. Keep the formula
2. Test different hooks
3. Test different CTAs

**If Day 2 post gets >250 views:**
1. Double down on this formula
2. Test posting at 3pm instead of 2pm

## Day 1 Actions Completed:

- [ ] Identified best post (Post 1 with 198 views)
- [ ] Analyzed hook, format, mentions
- [ ] Created formula template
- [ ] Ready to implement tomorrow

**Remember:** This is just one post. The algorithm needs to see patterns, not one-off successes. Be consistent.
