# Nifty 100 Swing Trade Criteria

## Overview
This document defines the technical and fundamental criteria for identifying swing trade setups in Nifty 100 stocks. A swing trade typically lasts 3-15 days and captures 5-10% moves using technical analysis and market structure.

---

## 1. Technical Setup

### Price Action (Either/Or)
- **Uptrend Continuation:** Price above 20 EMA AND below 50 EMA
  - Indicates stock is pulling back in an uptrend
  - Lower risk continuation pattern
  
- **Recovery Play:** Price below 20 EMA AND above 200 EMA
  - Indicates stock is oversold but in long-term uptrend
  - Higher reward but higher risk setup

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- **Range:** 40-60
- **Rationale:** Avoids overbought (>70) and oversold (<30) extremes
- **Sweet Spot:** 45-55 (balanced momentum, room to run)
- **Avoid:** RSI >70 (exhaustion likely) or <30 (panic selling)

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- **Signal:** Bullish crossover (MACD line crosses ABOVE signal line)
- **Confirmation:** Histogram should be positive and expanding
- **Avoid:** Bearish divergence or negative histogram

### Volume
- **Criterion:** Volume > 1.5x of 20-day average
- **Rationale:** Confirms institutional participation and breakout validity
- **Red Flag:** Low volume moves lack conviction and often reverse

## 2. Risk Management

### Stop Loss Placement
- **Level:** 2% below entry price
- **Logic:** Tight stops reduce capital at risk per trade
- **Example:** Entry at ₹100 → Stop at ₹98 (Risk = ₹2)

### Profit Targets
- **Target 1 (Partial Exit):** 5% above entry (Risk/Reward = 1:2.5)
  - Exit 50% of position here to lock in gains
  - Example: Entry ₹100 → Target 1 ₹105, sell 50% position
  
- **Target 2 (Full Exit):** 8% above entry (Risk/Reward = 1:4)
  - Remaining 50% position moves to breakeven after T1 exit
  - Example: Entry ₹100 → Target 2 ₹108, sell remaining 50%

### Position Sizing
- **Per Trade:** 1-2% of total capital
- **Calculation:** If capital = ₹100,000, per trade = ₹1,000-₹2,000
- **Stop Loss Amount:** ₹20 (on 1% capital) or ₹40 (on 2% capital)
- **Position Quantity:** Determine shares based on SL% and capital allocation

### Concurrent Positions
- **Maximum:** 3 concurrent open swing trades
- **Rationale:** Limits portfolio heat and management overhead
- **Management:** Close worst performer if 4th signal appears

---

## 3. Market Filters (Prerequisite)

### Nifty 50 Trend
- **Criterion:** Nifty 50 index above its 20 EMA
- **Rationale:** No shorting uptrend in falling market; reduces whipsaws
- **Check:** Intraday before initiating any swing setup

### Market Volatility (VIX)
- **Criterion:** VIX < 20 (lower volatility environment)
- **Rationale:** Trends are cleaner with lower volatility; avoid choppy markets
- **Caution:** VIX > 25 suggests high chop, reduced setup reliability

---

## 4. Fundamental Criteria (For Longer-Term Swings)

Use these filters for multi-week swings (10-15 days) to avoid fundamental shocks.

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- **Criterion:** Debt/Equity < 1.5x
- **Rationale:** Strong balance sheet reduces default risk
- **High Risk:** DE > 2.0 (fragile, vulnerable to sector shocks)

### Revenue Growth (YoY)
- **Criterion:** > 10% year-over-year growth
- **Rationale:** Growing companies have better earnings momentum
- **Source:** Latest quarterly results or annual reports

### Market Capitalization
- **Minimum:** ₹500 Crores
- **Rationale:** Ensures adequate liquidity and institutional coverage
- **Excludes:** Micro-cap stocks with wide bid-ask spreads

## 5. Setup Scoring (Strength Rating 1-10)

Calculate setup strength as a composite score:

| Factor | Points | Weight |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Price Action Match | 2 | 20% |
| RSI in sweet spot (45-55) | 2 | 20% |
| MACD Bullish Crossover | 2 | 20% |
| Volume Confirmation | 2 | 20% |
| Fundamentals Sound | 2 | 20% |

**Scoring:**
- 9-10: Excellent (high conviction, all conditions met)
- 7-8: Good (4-5 conditions met, high quality)
- 5-6: Fair (3-4 conditions met, medium quality)
- 3-4: Weak (2 conditions met, entry with caution)
- <3: Poor (do not trade)

**Trade Only:** Setups rated 6 or above

---

## 6. Exit Rules

### Profit Taking
1. **At Target 1 (5% gain):** Exit 50% of position, move SL to breakeven
2. **At Target 2 (8% gain):** Exit remaining 50% of position
3. **Breakeven Rule:** After T1 hit, SL cannot close below entry price

### Stop Loss Exit
- **Hard Stop:** Exit immediately if price closes below SL
- **No Emotions:** Do not move SL lower; accept loss and move to next setup

### Time-Based Exit
- **Hold Period:** Max 15 days for swing trade
- **Day 15 Exit:** If targets not hit, exit at market close
- **Rationale:** Prevents "swing" from becoming "carry-forward"

---

## 7. Trade Journal Requirements

Log every trade with:
- Entry date, symbol, price, position size
- Entry reason (setup type: continuation/recovery)
- Stop loss and targets
- Exit date, price, P&L, reason (target/SL/time)
- Setup strength rating at entry
- Lessons learned

**Review:** Weekly to identify patterns and improve setup selection.

## 8. Example Trade

**Setup:** RELIANCE on 2026-02-25

- **Entry:** ₹2,850 (Price above 20 EMA, below 50 EMA)
- **Setup Strength:** 8/10 (all conditions strong)
- **Position Size:** 1% of ₹100k = ₹1,000 capital
- **Shares:** ₹1,000 ÷ ₹2,850 = 0.35 shares (round to execution rules)
- **Stop Loss:** 2% below = ₹2,793 (Risk = ₹57)
- **Target 1:** 5% above = ₹2,992.50 (Sell 50%)
- **Target 2:** 8% above = ₹3,078 (Sell remaining 50%)

**Outcome:** Hit Target 1 on day 3
- Exit 50% at ₹2,992.50 → Gain = ₹142.50
- Move SL to ₹2,850 (breakeven)
- Hold remaining for T2 or 8% drop from entry

---

## 9. Constraints & Cautions

- **No earnings trades:** Avoid 5 days before/after earnings (volatility spike)
- **No illiquid stocks:** Average volume must support entry/exit without slippage
- **No averaging down:** Never buy more at lower prices in losses
- **No holding overnight gaps:** Strict SL discipline (no Sunday night gaps with large positions)

---

## 10. Rebalancing & Monitoring

- **Daily check:** At market open (09:15 IST) for fresh setups
- **Intra-day monitoring:** Check at 11:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 3:30 PM IST
- **Weekly review:** Analyze filled trades and journal entries
- **Monthly assessment:** Win rate, avg profit/loss, accuracy of setup strength rating
